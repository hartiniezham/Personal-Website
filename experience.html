          <td>For a year during my secondary school years, I worked at Koperasi Sekolah SMK Gombak Setia. I was 14 years old at the time. I only work one day a week from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. If there aren't enough workers, I sometimes take their place. I am in charge of the food, beverages, and snacks section. Despite the fact that my salary is only RM2.00 per day, I am satisfied with the experience I have gained. We get tired working there because we have to prepare food like sate kebab, which has to be grilled, and drink, which has to be mixed first. Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to work there because I have learned new ways to serve customers and have the opportunity to spend time with friends.</td>
          <td>During the school holidays in 2014-2015, I helped my brother with his business. He conducts business in Negeri Sembilan's Senawang and Seremban. He sells items such as steamboats and food that must be grilled. We opened the stalls every day, and it was an experience I'll never forget.</td>
          <td>Now I work part-time in a small company owned by my brother while studying. I assist my brother in packing and delivering packages, and more. Working here is a lot of fun because I'm surrounded by my family.</td>
