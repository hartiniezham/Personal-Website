    <p>This is a photograph of my family. I am the youngest out of five brothers. I grew up in a loving family and lead a simple life. Our family had more than enough food, clothing, and a comfortable place to live. I am extremely grateful for this life.</p>

    <div class="desc">My parents</div>

    <p>Both of my parents are featured in the photo above. Che Mhd Ezham bin Amat is the name of my father. On February 20, 1960, he was born. He is 62 years old in 2022. My father grew up in the Kelantan town of Kota Bharu. He had moved to Kuala Lumpur at the age of 20 in search of a permanent job. He began working as a clerk in a business. Following that, he worked as a police officer in Malaysia's capital. He has received an offer to work at a Petronas company at <abbr title="Kuala Lumpur City Centre">KLCC</abbr> after working for more than ten years. In his twenties, he met my mother in the neighbourhood where she worked. After many years of friendship, they decided to embark on the next stage of their lives by marrying. My father is a wonderful father. My father always concerned with the children's well-being and comfort. He carried out his responsibilities as a father very well.</p>

    <p>Now I'd like to tell you about my mother. Jamnah Binti Sulaiman is the name of my mother. She was born in Pahang on November 6, 1959. My mother lived in Pahang with her family until she was 18 years old. Following that, my mother relocated to Kuala Lumpur in order to find work because the job opportunities there were greater than in her village. My mother works as a chef in a hospital in Kuala Lumpur. She has worked in the same place from the age of 18 to the age of 55. My mother is a strong woman who does an excellent job as a mother. She never failed to provide for his six children. Even if she is very busy at work, she will make sure that enough food is cooked at home. </p>

        <div class="desc">My First Brother</div>
        <p>My eldest brother is Mohd Amli bin Che Mhd Ezham. He is 35 years old now. He used to work as an interior designer in Kuala Lumpur's Damansara district. However, he suffered a stroke in 2018 that rendered half of his body and he unable to move without the assistance of other people's energy. As a result, he can now not work and support his family. He is married to a lovely woman and has two adorable daughters. They now live in Rasah Jaya, Seremban. When Mohd Amli was still in school, he looked after his siblings, including me. He is a good brother, in my opinion, because he has managed to care for his siblings to this day. I appreciate his kindness and compassion. I plan to look for a job with an excellent salary to help his family in the future.

                <div class="desc">Hartini</div>
                    <p>Hi, this is me. I am the youngest child and only daughter. My family and friends refer to me as "Tini" and "Adik." This year marks my 22nd birthday. I am a student at the Universiti Teknologi MARA in Rembau, Negeri Sembilan. I'm already in my final semester. I'll be finished with my studies in just a few weeks. Of course, if the opportunity arises, I will continue my studies to the degree level. I'm a little shy in public. However, I am very enthusiastic about learning and work very hard to achieve excellent results. My only hope for this semester is that I will be able to get flying colors in the semester 5 final results. I'm sure it will warm the hearts of those around me. But if I can't achieve excellent results, I must accept with open arms. Whatever God's decision is, I'm fine with it. What matters most now is that I simply have to put forth my best effort to realise my ambitions. Indeed, effort is the most important factor in any situation.</p>
